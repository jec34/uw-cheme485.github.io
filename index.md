## Course Objectives

1. Express physical phenomena (e.g. heat, mass, momentum transfer) as mathematical models.
2. Classify ordinary and partial differential equations (e.g. homogeneity, order, and linearity).
3. Visualize behavior of ordinary and partial differential equations without performing a complete solution.
4. Implement analytical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations using both exact and approximate methods.
5. Implement numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations using the finite difference method.

## Software Requirements

As homeworks will be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks, students will need to have Python and a package manager available on their computers. The best instructions for proper installation are found on the [Software Carpentry website](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-01-15-uw/) (scroll down to the **Setup** section). Please have this installed prior to the first day of class. We will cover the basics of Python, Markdown, and GitHub the first week of class to ensure you can properly submit homeworks.
