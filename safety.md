As homeworks will be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks, students will need to have Python and a package manager available on their computers. The best instructions for proper installation are found on the [Software Carpentry website](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-01-15-uw/) (scroll down to the **Setup** section). Please have this installed prior to the first day of class. We will cover the basics of Python, Markdown, and GitHub the first week of class to ensure you can properly submit homeworks. -->
